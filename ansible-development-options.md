# Ansible Development Environment Options 

## Local Development Options 

Local setups are ideal if you want direct control over the environment, low-latency editing and offline capabilities. 

1. **Python Virtual Environment**

    A Python Virtual Environment (venv) allows you to isolate your Ansible dependencies without affecting your system-wide Python installation.

    **Benefits:**
    - Lightweight and fast to set up.
    - Perfect for working on multiple projects with different Ansible versions.
    - Avoids dependency conflicts with other Python projects.

    **Typical Workflow:**

    ```
    python3 -m venv ansible-venv
    source ansible-venv/bin/activate
    pip install ansible ansible-lint
    ```

    **Best for:** Developers who prefer simplicity and minimal tooling overhead. 


2. **Docker/Podman Desktop**
    
    Running Ansible inside a container ensures a fully reproducible and clean environment every time.

    **Benefits:**
    - Consistent environment across development machines.
    - Easy to reset or switch between configurations.
    - Ideal for integrating with CI/CD pipelines.

    **Best for:** Teams needing consistent builds and isolated environments without polluting local systems.

## Remote Development Options 

Remote setups are ideal for collaborative work, resource-heavy tasks, and when you need a consistent environment accessible from anywhere. 


3. **Code Server**

    Code Server runs Visual Studio Code in a browser, allowing you to connect to a remote Ansible-ready environment. 

    **Benefits:** 
    - Access from any device with a browser
    - Same VS Code extensions and settings everywhere
    - Easy to share environments with teammates

    **Best for:** Distributed teams that want a familiar IDE in a cloud-accessible form.

4. **Remote SSH**

    With VS Code Remote SSH, you connect to a remote server or VM where Ansible is installed. 

    **Benefits:**
    - Full control over a powerful remote machine 
    - Leverage remote compute resourcces while keeping local machine lightweight
    - Minimal setup if SSH access is already available 

    **Best for:** Developer who want low-latency terminal performance but remote compute power.

5. **OpenShift Dev Spaces**

    OpenShift Dev Spaces provides a cloud-based, containerized development environment integrated directly with OpenShift. 

    **Benefits:** 
    - Preconfigured workspaces with Ansible tools
    - Integration with GitOps and CI/CD Workflows 
    - Runs directl in the same cluster where automation will be deployed 

    **Best for:** Teams already working in an OpenShift ecosystem who want a fully managed, enterprise-ready dev platform.

## Recommendations
- If using Option 2, use the [VS Code with Ansible and Dev Containers Extensions](https://github.com/enzobercasio/ansible-resources/blob/master/ansible-dev-server-vs-code-dev-containers.md) approach.
- You can use hybrid approach. For example, prototyping locally in a container [option 2] and then test playbooks in an OpenShift Dev Spaces workspace [option 5] before committing to production.
